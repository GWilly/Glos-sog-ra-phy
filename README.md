---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Objective:**

Using GitHub Pages and stackedit.io, prepare a small webpage that identifies a passage from Barnes and discusses its internal evidence and external evidence.  Include some form of media (images count, but don't feel restricted), a careful analysis of what some portion of the text might mean, and some evidence from an external source that you find through Harner.  (for example, you can use the bibliographies of bibliographies to find something more specific to the sort of question you're posing to the text)

Post a link to your page and a *short* narrative of how you found the external source and why you picked that one, rather than a different one.  Try to find a good one or at least one you think will be useful for the sort of questions that interest you.

**Passage:**

"This be a Love Letter for a Present, and when she is Catched, what shall I do with her?  God knows!  For 'tis safe to say I do not, and what we know not, is our only proof of Him!" - February (Barnes 14)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analysis:**

I believe that this passage refers to a girl or woman whom Dame Musset is attempting to "catch" (Barnes 14).  We can identify that it is Dame Musset due to the fact that in comparison to January, this chapter varies with the tone and stance regarding female same sex relationships.  The main character featured in January is Patience Scalpel, a very traditional woman that looks down upon this subject, even calling these types of women "sluts" (Barnes 13).  During that time period, even sleeping with the husband in the same bed was not part of the cultural norm: "Women came to enough trouble by lying abed with the Father of their Children" (Barnes 12). However, compared to February, there is a shift in this view, as Dame Musset tries to attract her love.  This contrast is very striking as it points out the shifting of ideologies during this time period, tradition versus modernity.  

Another very important aspect of this passage is the presence of God, and the relationship between gender and religion during this time period.  From the images to the text, religion seems to be a vital part of this book. Saint, Prophet, God, Lord, and Religion are some examples of words that portray and relate to religion in the text.  From my own analysis, I believe that religion is mentioned in order to provide support and also contrast the topic of lesbianism.  Usually, religion is used as a basis for going back to old traditions, questioning why things should change (in this case lesbianism).  However, it seems that Religion is used to glorify Dame Musset with illustrious examples of her as a "Saint" and images that feature her holiness.  "...Religion too late for Religion" (Barnes 23) must represent a newfound ideology in terms of women's rights and freedom that was praised during this time which goes against traditional views.  An example of one of the images is found below (Barnes 16).

I found my source (Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures. 2 vols. New York: Garland, 2000. Garland Reference Lib. of the Social Sciences 1002, 1008. HQ75.13 306.766.) by typing in lesbianism in the search bar of the Literary Research Guide.  Specifically, I chose Vol. 1: Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia. Ed. Bonnie Zimmerman. 862 pp. HQ75.5.L4395 306.76′63′03.  I remember Taylor doing this in our first forum post and I decided to narrow my search on the specific topic.  I picked this source because I was interested in finding out if there was a women's movement or a rise in lesbianism during the book's time period.  It would be very helpful in understanding the situation during that period, whether lesbianism was accepted or if society was intolerant and how it could be represented in the book.

Using the external source, I first read the introduction which informed me that the beginnings of homosexuality began around 1869 and spread into literature around 1900 - 1930 (Haggerty et al. IX).  I was quiet interested in this fact because the book was published in 1928 (within this time span).  I also found out that Djuna Barnes' birth date was in 1892 so this may have affected her childhood, and may have led her to pursue this topic of lesbianism due to that curiousity.  During the early 1900s, the majority of people even scholarly institutions looked down upon these types of research and literature and drove it underground (Haggerty et al. X), which answers my previous question that society was intolerant of such topics.  This external source actually revealed much about Djuna Barnes' life as there is an entry about her.  From what the source indicated, this passage could be a representation of Djuna Barnes' "most intense love interest," Thelma Wood (Haggerty et al. 93).  The source did not really explain much about why there is a prominent presence of religion in the book, other than the fact that Djuna Barnes may have been a very religious woman.  However, the entry of Barnes outlines that due to her weird childhood (filled with incestous deeds and sexual violence) (Haggerty et al. 93), this may have led her to create these texts to showcase her life through the names of her own characters.  Going back to my previous internal source analysis, Patience Scalpel could represent the modern institutions and the majority of society that see lesbianism as a cultural taboo.  While on the other hand, Dame Musset is the embodiment of this new stance on gender norms and may represent Barnes' stance on this topic.
