# Continue your page

Take the page you've already written on GitHub and identify a question or two that strikes your interest.  Find an additional source, pick an additional passage from Barnes, and build a new site that uses the material from your old site, answers the question(s), and writes new material.

Use at least one new technical tool from this week--Twine, Cascading Style-Sheets, videos, etc.
