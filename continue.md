# Continue Your Page

Take the page you've already written on GitHub and identify a question or two that strikes your interest.  Find an additional source, pick an additional passage from Barnes, and build a new site that uses the material from your old site, answers the question(s), and writes new material.

Use at least one new technical tool from this week--Twine, Cascading Style-Sheets, videos, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions:

1. What would you expect to find in the other volume of this source?  Would it help support your evidence in anyway?
2. Could you expand a little more on her strange childhood? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Passage:

"I think of that day, forty years ago, when I, a Child of ten, was deflowered by the Hand of a Surgeon!" - March (Barnes 24)
