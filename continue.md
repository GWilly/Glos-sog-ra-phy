Questions:

1. Could you expand a little more on her strange childhood? 
2. Why do you feel the majority of society still sees lesbianism as a cultural taboo?

New Passage:

"I think of that day, forty years ago, when I, a Child of ten, was deflowered by the Hand of a Surgeon!" - March (Barnes 24)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis:

In order to answer the first question, I had to refer back to my main source, Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures. 2 vols. New York: Garland, 2000. Garland Reference Lib. of the Social Sciences 1002, 1008. HQ75.13 306.766.  Barnes' early life seemed to be met with a lot of sexual involvement within her family, "Evidence points to a violent sexual experience when Barnes was sixteen with a friend of her father, with the older brother of Barnes’s father’s mistress, or with Barnes’s father himself," (Haggerty et al. 93).  Not only that, but it seems that "Correspondence may indicate an incestuous relationship between the writer and her grandmother as well" (Haggerty et al. 93).  It seems that from a young age, Barnes was involved in both male and female relationships which may have affected her views on sexuality and inspired her to write this book.  The new passage that I found in the book "I think of that day, forty years ago, when I, a Child of ten, was deflowered by the Hand of a Surgeon!" (Barnes 24), is of Dame Musset recalling her childhood.  This is strikingly similar to Barnes' case in which she was sixteen when she had her first sexaul encounters and the Surgeon may represent one of these male relations she had.

This passage can also be used to answer the next question, "Why do you feel the majority of society still sees lesbianism as a cultural taboo?"  In this case, lesbianism is seen as a cultural taboo because people wonder what makes these men and women, fall for their own sex.  For Barnes, it appears to be her early sexual relationships that led her down this path, although there might be other factors as well.  The new source that I found was called Queer Theory (Hall, Donald E., and Wolfreys, Julian. Queer Theories. Gordonsville, GB: Palgrave Macmillan Ltd., 2002. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 4 February 2017.).  This source explains that viewpoints differ with regards to time, and culture.  Compared to India versus here in the United States, two men holding hands may be judged as having sexual relations in the U.S. but not in rural India (Hall and Wolfreys 25).  I still feel that the majority of society still sees lesbianism as a cultural taboo due largely to the culture that has been molded throughout the centuries.  Although homosexuality has occured in the past, it was very widely antagonized and forced underground.  The majority of texts and cultural ideals widely focused on heterosexuality thus leading to our current cultural views that lesbianism is not the norm.
