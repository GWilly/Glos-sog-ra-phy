Questions:

1. Could you expand a little more on her strange childhood? 
2. Why do you feel the majority of society still sees lesbianism as a cultural taboo?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Passage:

"I think of that day, forty years ago, when I, a Child of ten, was deflowered by the Hand of a Surgeon!" - March (Barnes 24)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis:

In order to answer the first question, I had to refer back to my main source, Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures. 2 vols. New York: Garland, 2000. Garland Reference Lib. of the Social Sciences 1002, 1008. HQ75.13 306.766.  Barnes' early life seemed to be met with a lot of sexual involvement within her family, "Evidence points to a violent sexual experience when Barnes was sixteen with a friend of her father, with the older brother of Barnes’s father’s mistress, or with Barnes’s father himself," (Haggerty et al. 93).  Not only that, but it seems that "Correspondence may indicate an incestuous relationship between the writer and her grandmother as well" (Haggerty et al. 93).  It seems that from a young age, Barnes was involved in both male and female relationships which may have affected her views on sexuality and inspired her to write this book.  The new passage that I found in the book "I think of that day, forty years ago, when I, a Child of ten, was deflowered by the Hand of a Surgeon!" (Barnes 24), is of Dame Musset recalling her childhood.  This is strikingly similar to Barnes' case in which she was sixteen when she had her first sexaul encounters and the Surgeon may represent one of these male relations she had.
